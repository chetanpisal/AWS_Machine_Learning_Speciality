A factorization machine is a general-purpose supervised learning algorithm you can use for both classification and regression tasks. It is an extension of a linear model that is designed to capture interactions between features within high dimensional sparse data sets economically. For example, in a click prediction system, the factorization machine model can capture click rate patterns observed when ads from a certain ad category are placed on pages from a certain page category. Factorization machines are a good choice for tasks dealing with high dimensional sparse data sets, such as click prediction and item recommendation.
